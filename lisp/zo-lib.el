PACKAGE is a symbol (or list of them) referring to Emacs features (aka

- An unquoted package symbol (the name of a package)
    (after! helm BODY...)
- An unquoted, nested list of compound package lists, using any combination of
  :or/:any and :and/:all

- An unquoted list of package symbols (i.e. BODY is evaluated once both magit
  and git-gutter have loaded)
    (after! (magit git-gutter) BODY...)
  If :or/:any/:and/:all are omitted, :and/:all are implied.

This emulates `eval-after-load' with a few key differences:

1. No-ops for package that are disabled by the user (via `package!') or not
   installed yet.
2. Supports compound package statements (see :or/:any and :and/:all above).
